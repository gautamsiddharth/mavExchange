MavExchange is a platform for only UTA students to buy, trade, or loan items from each other. Students at college campuses often have similar needs, as they take similar classes or attend the same events. This platform provides an environment to exchange items between UTA students whether it be old textbooks or foam fingers for basketball games. Users can post items they need, want to sell, or would like to trade for and comment on posts with questions or offers.
        In this project we applied Java Programming, Android Studio framework and Firebase Real time Database. 

Functions:
Post: Users can make a post to trade, auction, sell, or loan items. Users will be able to add pictures, descriptions, and tags to their posts. Other users can also post comments with questions or counteroffers.

Filter: Users can filter posts by item type, time posted, price, and tags to help users find what they are looking for easily. 
	
Direct Message: Users can direct messages to another user to ask questions about items posted.

Register: Users can register and make an account with their UTA net ID. This will help ensure that only UTA students are able to register for the app. Having an account will also allow users to direct messages to each other.

Favorite: Users can favorite posts which will be listed on their favorites page, so they can come back to it later.
